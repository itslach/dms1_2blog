The process of this assignment taught me an incredible amount UI/UX design and helped me further my knowledge about the design process. I came into this project with an eagerness in the UI field and found that I was able to create an easily navigatable interface that effectively conveyed my self reflection and past works over the last semester. I believe I faced numerous challenges over the completion of this assignment, especially with managing my time on this project, but I believe I was able to overcome these challenges and effectively and come out with an end result that I am thoroughly proud of. I believe if I was presented with the opportunity to complete this project again I would go more in depth to how I felt over the past completions of projects and would implement more intricate details into my portfolio, although I had said I was going to have alot of static elements to my design, I now wish I had implemented more moving parts.
