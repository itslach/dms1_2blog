Branching on from the wireframes in the last task, I decided to take a different approach to the layout of my portfolio website, I had decided I wanted a large part of the portfolio to be static, especially parts of the projects, so the user could just scroll through and observe the work clearly, I also wanted to implement large, eye catching text to the front page of the website, keeping the same header menu from the original wireframe, I also added a live clock of the time in Melbourne, to add a touch of creativity to the front page.

I also created some graphic visuals to add depth to the portfolio, I created a simple and quick grunge edit for the background to the page and a 3D flow animation to go beneath my student number. I believe this made my portfolio look very futuristic and eye catching.
