Branching on from the wireframes in the last task, I decided to take a different approach to the layout of my portfolio website, I had decided I wanted a large part of the portfolio to be static, especially parts of the projects, so the user could just scroll through and observe the work clearly, I also wanted to implement large, eye catching text to the front page of the website, keeping the same header menu from the original wireframe, I also added a live clock of the time in Melbourne, to add a touch of creativity to the front page. 

<style>
  .custom-font {
    font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
  }
</style>

I also created some graphic visuals to add depth to the portfolio, I created a simple and quick grunge edit for the background to the page and a 3D flow animation to go beneath my student number. I believe this made my portfolio look very futuristic and eye catching.

After creating the home page, I added in the tab for my personal work, simply creating horizontal scrolling tabs for each frame, and then implementing different projects I've worked on or done myself.

I then moved onto creating the project 1 tab, this was a very simple addition to the portfolio as the majority of the prokect was static, which meant there isn't alot of moving aspects. I decided to make the layout alternating between the imagess and text, and added seperate overlays for each image, which meant when an image was clicked it would open a larger overlay.

  .custom-font {
    font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;

The purpose of this was to make the project more interactive for the user. I also added the title of the project in the middle of everything, turning the text into it's own component I made it so that when the mouse is hovering over the text it shifts from black to red.

  .custom-font {
    font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;

The information I added for this project went into depth describing the design choices and practices I made to achieve a final result, while also reflecting on all my processes and whether I think I did them to the best of my ability.
