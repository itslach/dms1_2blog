I faced a variety of challenges when trying to design an initial storyboard and really decide on a direction that I wanted to take my project. My first thought was just to create a mashup/montage of video clips about things that I was interested in, and my plan was to go out with my camera and just film random stuff that I in the moment thought was interesting, after spending a considerable amount of consideration on this topic I opted against doing something like that, although it may have seemed very abstract, I wasn't sure I would really be able to relate anything of the footage I would find back to my own personality and who I am. I really wanted to convey a certain emotional tone to the audience, I wanted to convey nostalgic and adventurous tones in my self portrait. I used very basic drawings and 5 AI generated images in this storyboard, I used simple drawings to effectively just show any movement in scenes and what events would be happening, and AI generated images for scenes that would be more detailed which I was unable to draw very well. Throughout my film I want continuity to drive the video, with it all flowing very smoothly, I believe this will help keep the viewers attention and create a pleasant viewing experience, however I also want to use atleast 2 deliberate moments of discontuinity, the music used in my film will be very upbeat with a fast tempo and happy melodic sounds, this will help to drive the transitions in the film, that will be synced to change with musical changes, the moments of discontuinity will break this synchresis, with the existing music track fading out and gradually being replaced by either a very somber, and ambient track or something very loud and aggressive, I want to use these moments to keep the viewers attention reactive and change the tone of the video for a few seconds. I'm aiming to use a variety of fade and cut techniques to reinforce these tones and feelings to the viewer, and push the main theme/concept of nostalgia and memories.
