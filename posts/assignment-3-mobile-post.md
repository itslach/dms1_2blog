The next step once I had the desktop layout in a place that I felt was looking good, was to adapt all these layouts to the mobile frame. It was obvious to me that the way I had laid everything out would have to change slightly, just to adhere to the restrictions of a mobile screen.

I decided that I was going to replicate the same layout from the desktop as best as I could, for the main page of the mobile, I decided to scrap some of the elements of the header menu, and move the background video down, have the main title be a stand-alone element of the page. I also kept the element that addressed what I was interested in at the moment.

The next step was to add the personal works portion of the portfolio, I kept the layout of this the exact same as the desktop page, as I loved the layout of it on the original and didn't want to change this, all that had to be changed was reducing the size of it to fit the constraints of the screen size. To achieve this it was quite straight forward, I essentially pulled apart the frames and reduced the individual sizes of each image and placed them into new frames made for the mobile layout.

The most challenging part of this was adjusting the project layouts to fit the mobile screen, because of the way I aligned the first project to fit the screen, I had to slightly alter the way everything was placed to make it fit, I kept the same colour scheme and image designs across both screens, I changed the alternating layout to a simple vertical layout, with it simply going from image-text-image-text etc.

Once I finished importing the first project into my mobile frame, I then moved onto the second project. For this project I kept the header portion almost identical to the desktop, just with the placement on the gradient being slightly adjusted due to framing. Instead of having the scrolling graphics along the side of the text cards, I placed the scrolling icons as the first part of the project, with the further description coming after this.

<style>
  .custom-font {
    font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
  }
</style>

<p class="custom-font">
I used the same cards for the text that I had used on the desktop, just changing the size of the cards and the size of the text. I also moved the video of icons being used from the side of the screen into the middle, with the respective button and overlay being moved to fit the screen portion properly. I had to unfortunately remove one of the iterations that were displayed on the cards, and remove them from the card, placing them beside a seperate text card instead.

<p class="custom-font">
In the later half of the project, the desktop layout has a series of images aligned with 3 text cards going vertically down the screen, I was unable to recreate this in the mobile frame without making the text non-legible. To counter this I seperated the images into sets of 2/3. I used them to split up each of the text cards, similar to the pattern I had used in the first project layout.

<style>
  .custom-font {
    font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
  }
</style>

<p class="custom-font">
I  then added the next project button underneath the reflection and made it much bigger, to fill more of the screen, this was done purposefully to make it more obvious to the person viewing it, and to make it easier to interact with.

The hardest part of this entire process was replicating the third project page into a mobile frame. Because I utilised the horizontal scrolling for the desktop frame, I had to find a way to alter this to fit a different frame. Before I tackled that problem I added the title, header, back button and the guide button, instead of having the title aspect aligned to the left side, I decided to keep all the text aligned towards the left, but center the information in the middle of the screen, I the images from the carousel as a horizontal list on the page, with no scrolling. I found this to be the easiest way to do this as having horizontal scrolling on a mobile screen was not something I wanted to have.

<style>
  .custom-font {
    font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
  }
</style>

<p class="custom-font">
I kept the same overlays for each image and the same system of viewing them, because I had to resize each image to fit the mobile screen, I was recquired to duplicate all the overlays for each image and resize them accordingly.
