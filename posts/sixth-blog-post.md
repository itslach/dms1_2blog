## *A KEY MOMENT*

A key moment in my two minute self portrait video is the first moment of discontinuity with the tree line and peaceful music, I am aiming to complete this by using an L-cut to gradually begin fading the soundtrack of the film out, and slowly fade in a quiet ambient song with a J-cut and use of the 'constant gain' effect, once the clip is showing I will also be utilising royalty free samples to add a nature/bird sample, adding a layer of depth to the scene and materialising it. I'll be trying to forge a connection between peacefulness and nature and push that to the audience in this scene, while focusing on tones of tranquility and nostalgia, the use of synchresis between what the audience is seeing, hearing and feeling with further help to create this relationship. The tempo of the ambient music will be quite slow (between 35-50bpm) and will have no rhythm, to convey that life around us is random and has no set rhythm or 'path', the success of my project will be relying on this moment as I believe it will create a moment that further engages the audience and envokes them to relate to what they're perceiving.
