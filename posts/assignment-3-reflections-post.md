# **STUDIO REFLECTIONS**

## **STUDIO ASSIGNMENT_3**

<ul class="custom-list">
  <li><strong> How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit?</strong></li>
  <li> I had aimed for the visual elements of the assignment to be spatially timed within the video with the sonic elements of the video, this meant  creating a synchesis between the image changes and camera flash sound effects, and having climax’s and important times within the audio track syncing to major parts of the video aspect. </li>
  <li><strong> How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape  your project?</strong></li>
  <li> I knew from the moment the brief was addressed to us that I wanted to create a contrasting video, that displayed moments from my life before I had moved to Melbourne and moments from after, this meant I knew I was going to use a substantial amount of pre-recorded footage within the first portion of my video, and set out to film random moments that I found important for the second half. </li>
  <li><strong> How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project? </strong></li>
  <li> I wanted to tell somewhat of a story within the time of my project, editing for this was crucial as it determines how quickly or slowly a story unfolds, I deliberately used quick cuts to create urgency within the video and attempted to create smooth/sharp transitions that wouldn’t break or disrupt the pacing of the video. With rhythm, I wanted to utilize a music track that would help build the structure of the video, the music had to be well edited to be felt through the arrangement of scenes of shots and when used effectively, I wanted it to affect how the user felt when viewing the project. </li>
  <li><strong> Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to depict in your portrait? </strong></li>
  <li> I chose to depict majorly my past memories through my project, using real clips that had been filmed candid and in the moment, I believed they conveyed a sense of rawness and blissfulness, which are personality traits that I believe were present within myself during the time and now, I chose not to focus too heavily on my future self, as I am still unclear as to where I want to be in life in the future. </li>
  <li><strong> What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your work? </strong></li>
  <li> I went for a more laidback/beachy/’music video’ style edit for my work, this was done to convey not only the overall theme and vibe of the video, but also to convey the person I was throughout this video, every aspect of the video, from the music to the transitions to the footage was all deliberately picked/used to structure these aesthetics. I wanted my video to feel like you were watching a early 2010’s, beach band music video. </li>
