# **STUDIO REFLECTIONS**

## **STUDIO ASSIGNMENT_1**

<ul class="custom-list">
  <li><strong> How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit?</strong></li>
  <li> I had aimed for the visual elements of the assignment to be spatially timed within the video with the sonic elements of the video, this meant  creating a synchesis between the image changes and camera flash sound effects, and having climax’s and important times within the audio track syncing to major parts of the video aspect. </li>
  <li><strong> How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape  your project?</strong></li>
  <li> I knew from the moment the brief was addressed to us that I wanted to create a contrasting video, that displayed moments from my life before I had moved to Melbourne and moments from after, this meant I knew I was going to use a substantial amount of pre-recorded footage within the first portion of my video, and set out to film random moments that I found important for the second half. </li>
  <li><strong> How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project? </strong></li>
  <li> I wanted to tell somewhat of a story within the time of my project, editing for this was crucial as it determines how quickly or slowly a story unfolds, I deliberately used quick cuts to create urgency within the video and attempted to create smooth/sharp transitions that wouldn’t break or disrupt the pacing of the video. With rhythm, I wanted to utilize a music track that would help build the structure of the video, the music had to be well edited to be felt through the arrangement of scenes of shots and when used effectively, I wanted it to affect how the user felt when viewing the project. </li>
  <li><strong> Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to depict in your portrait? </strong></li>
  <li> I chose to depict majorly my past memories through my project, using real clips that had been filmed candid and in the moment, I believed they conveyed a sense of rawness and blissfulness, which are personality traits that I believe were present within myself during the time and now, I chose not to focus too heavily on my future self, as I am still unclear as to where I want to be in life in the future. </li>
  <li><strong> What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your work? </strong></li>
  <li> I went for a more laidback/beachy/’music video’ style edit for my work, this was done to convey not only the overall theme and vibe of the video, but also to convey the person I was throughout this video, every aspect of the video, from the music to the transitions to the footage was all deliberately picked/used to structure these aesthetics. I wanted my video to feel like you were watching a early 2010’s, beach band music video. </li>
</ul>

## **STUDIO ASSIGNMENT_2**

<ul class="custom-list">
<li><strong>How would you summarize your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose the theme that you did?</strong></li>
<li> The overall theme/idea behind my suite of icons was to create an array of strongly alike icons that were intended to be used on a ‘sleep-sounds’ app. I had struggled to come up with an idea for the brief of ‘dreams’ for a while, until I was actually using a rain weather app on my phone one night as I was having trouble sleeping, I had contemplated how simple the icons were for each different sound you could play, and decided I would create something similar. </li>
<li><strong>Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?</strong></li>
<li> I went through several different iterations when creating my icons. I started with a completely different idea of creating icons for a video game, these icons used a more complex visual style and I still believe were created with a strong level of detail, the things they lacked however was that I struggled to see them together with any sense of coherence, they all had different shapes, colors and themes, and I just knew they wouldn’t work. I then tried to simplify these icons, and put them all on the same abstract circle background, with each 3 having a different color, this made me feel better about them, but now I was struggling to see how they would work in a video game, and ultimately this is when I scrapped that idea and went to the sleeping icons, I stuck with this idea because it was something I believed no one else would be doing, and was much easier for me to complete as the icons were simplified, overall I just felt very more proud of these icons. </li>
<li><strong>How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator? Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?</strong></li>
<li> When bringing my thumbnail sketches into Illustrator, the first lot of icons I was created were challenging to recreate with the pen tool in Illustrator, and I was still getting use to the hang of it so lots of more intricate details were lost in this re-creation, although at the time this felt like a big challenge to overcome it had actually provided me with enough practice going into my final set of icons, I was more fluid and comfortable with the pen tool and had learnt other quick tricks and hacks to create very professional looking vectors/icons. </li>
<li><strong>How did you use color to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why did you choose the palette that you did?</strong></li>
<li> I used color very strongly in the creation of my icons, before even creating the icons in Illustrator, I had started looking around at different color palettes I could use, I had decided on a split complementary palette, with a beautiful light green and light blue, I also threw a bright red and darkish brown into the palette, this was done to create a sense of contrast. All the icons used the same light green background, and the same 4 colors in every icon. This was done to create a strong sense of unity within the icons, so that someone looking at this set would immediately think they belong together, I also made it that on the change of each icon, the icon itself would get bigger and the content within the icon would have a drop shadow behind it, with a slight blur layered over the top, to clearly indicate a ‘in use’ and not in use state. </li>
<li><strong>How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?</li></strong>
<li>To create the link between the audio and visual aspects in my design, I had research into how different sounds would be effective in my project’s idea. In majority of these sleeping apps, they don’t play short snippets of sounds, when the icon is pressed the sound will continue to play until turned off, this was a constraint that, within my project I could not recreate, I decided to apply the idea that when the icon is interacted with, it would play a small snippet of the sound it represents. Once I had this idea down I had to go into finding different sound effects that matched the design of each icon, although while matching the icon, they also needed to make sense in the theme of my sleeping app. </li>
<li><strong>How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of concrete visual designs?</li></strong>
<li>I translated the prompt originally by brainstorming as many ideas as I could surrounding the brief of ‘dreams’, I had brainstormed different drawings that represented dreaming, child style drawings, heavily simplified icons like clouds, stars and moons, and then mythical style creatures to really delve deep into the ‘dream’ idea. When I eventually moved onto the sleeping icons idea, my first idea, and idea that I stuck with was to brainstorm icons that, when used by the user, a different icon/sound would help boost the corresponding aspect in the person’s life. This meant like sounds that would help; health, relationships, meditation, wealth, aspiration etc.</li>
</ul>

## **STUDIO ASSIGNMENT_3**

<ul class="custom-list">
<li><strong>How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that process?</strong></li>
<li>I found having a working prototype highly important in the designing process of my 3D environment, it allowed me to test my concept early on into the production of my project, this was highly useful as it meant I was able to shift my original design idea without losing too much progress. I found the Grey-box prototyping not as useful as in the early creation of my project, I found that for myself, it was a lot more useful too visualize the environment with textures and actual props in the scene, having untextured shapes, forms and objects was just too rough of an idea, and I also found that in the early aspects of production,  I had moved too fast for it to be an efficient aspect to focus on.</li>
<li><strong>How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional media?</strong></li>
<li>The experience of creating an interactive, 3D environment was incredibly different to that of creating a two-dimensional piece of media. When in the first design stages of creating this media, there is a lot more aspects to account for and imagine when designing. In my experiences of creating 2D media, the main things I needed to account for when designing is how the user with view the media and what feelings will be conveyed to them upon viewing, because 2D has a lot less environmental space to work with, it requires less intricate detailing then 3D. When it came to designing my 3D environment, I had to account for all spatial aspects of the area, I wanted the player to be able to move in a 3D space, jumping up and down while moving forward, backwards and side to side. I also needed to account for visuals in all directions, every direction the user looked in, the environment needed to look deliberate and meaningful.</li>
<li><strong>What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?</strong></li>
<li>The role of the virtual camera in my project was to take on the view of the player, I knew a large majority of projects in this assignment would have the camera as just a movable player, while lacking a possible interaction system, I decided to take this advantage and create an in-depth interaction system for my virtual camera/player. Creating the ability to; talk to characters, open/close doors, pick up items that go into an inventory and read notes that were scattered around the map. The role of the virtual camera in this environment was not only to experience what was surrounding them, but also to interact with it, and possibly deeper immerse the player into the 3D environment. The role of the camera from my first assignment has two deep aspects to it. On one hand, the role of the camera in each scene was to capture memories, to record pivotal moments throughout my life, allowing myself to look back on them and reminisce, on the other hand, the role of the camera was to present visual media to the viewer, to entertain them and invoke deliberate feelings towards the viewer.</li>
<li><strong>How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?</strong></li>
<li>Sound was a major aspect of my 3D environment project, it’s role was to create an immersive experience for the user, and create a strong structural base for each scene. I used different SFX in each scene, ranging from; upbeat music, forest ambience, uneasy music, dialogue SFX, flickering lights SFX and other SFX for interaction systems. This was similar to my uses of sound in Assignments 1 & 2 as sound in each assignment was a key aspect for conveying a core theme to the user/viewer, and create a purposeful experience for them. The sound in Assignments 1 & 3 were very similar as they were intended to be a foundation for the visuals of the media, and structurally lift the viewing experience, whereas in the 2nd Assignment, the sound was intended to accompany the visual icons and were just as important to the overall experience as the visuals were.</li>
<li><strong>How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?</strong></li>
<li>In the first designs of my environment I had unified the theme under a ‘low poly’ style environment and had stuck by this by using similar style objects and textures. My concept originally was not to create such an in-depth, interactive environment, but just to create a ‘walking-simulator’ style environment, in which the user just walks through a set environment, experiencing events around them. When I had lost my original project to the file becoming corrupted, I used this setback as a means of changing my theme and concept for the project. I decided to shift from the ‘low-poly’ style game to a retro inspired ‘PSX’ themed video game, with low graphics and janky physics.</li>
<li><strong>What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have discovered otherwise?</li>
<li> The process of having an outsider individual to playtest my 3D environment was very effective for me understanding how to elevate my project to the next level. I had gotten my partner to playtest my environment for me, this was done intentionally as she had little to no experience with video games, this meant I would be getting the interaction from what an average person is seeing and experiencing, this helped to see if my guides were strong enough for the player and if systems of interaction were obvious enough and not overlooked.</li>
