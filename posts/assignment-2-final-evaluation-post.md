Overall, for the duration of this assignment, I believe my project underwent numerous design changes. I started my project with the idea of making icons of characters for video games, targeted at teens, which quickly shifted to characters made for a clothing brand's website, that could be applied to different clothing items. This concept was one that I really stuck with and felt like I could complete well. Later on after designing all my icons, I realised that as much as I was drawn to this idea, it was very hard to apply it to the brief, having to have an icon that changes to a seperate image and play a sound. Because I was struggling so much to apply this concept to my icons, I decided to scrap them completely, starting from scratch again, I decided to create icons that could be used on a sleep sounds mobile app, targeting all age ranges and to be accessed across multiple mobile platforms such as; iPhone, Android, Google etc. I grew fonder of this concept, more than my last idea and found it much easier to create a set of 9 icons for this idea. After creating my icons my next task was to find a variety of audio snippets that could somehow fit with my theme. I had the idea to make the audio snippet that plays when the icon is pressed to be a snippet for the user to see what sleep sound plays for each icon, almost like a sample of the function for the user. With this theme in mind I searched for copyright free sfx for my icons, that the average person could use to help them fall asleep. I believe that, by adhering to the brief, I completed this Assignment to the best of my ability, and was able to apply design principles and thinking to my project, to create engaging and effective icons for my concept, and created a strong unity of style within in my icons, creating a feeling that the set of icons belong in a family together.
