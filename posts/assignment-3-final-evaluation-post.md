Throughout the creation of my 3D environment, I faced numerous struggles, errors and challenges. After now completing the project I believe that, to the best of my ability, I was able to overcome these challenges and come out with a final product that I am exceptionally proud and happy with. The biggest challenge I faced was the corruption of my first project, I had began creating a low-poly environment, I had spent countless hours already creating a scene that had put me vastly ahead of the expected level of completion, instead of letting this setback get to me and ruin what I had, I used it as a reason to start over, and ultimately create something even better.

I luckily had some part experience in creating a 'psx/playstation 1' style video game back when I was in highschool, I decided to take this part experience and use it effectively in my project, I decided to create an interactive experience for the player. Instead of just wandering through a 3D environment, I wanted them to be able to interact with parts of the scene, talk to NPC's and really become immersed in what they were experiencing.

I believe my technical proficiency in my project reflected advanced capabilities, I took it as a challenge to not outsource any of the coding aspects for the game, this meant all the coding aspects of the environment were made by me and took significant time and effort to create. I also believe my use of different environments to not only immerse the player in the environment, but also to push the motif/change for my project.

The motif for my project was the major change that I have gone through in my life, being that I moved from a coastal town to a major city, I found this very daunting and I was highly unsure about everything before, during and after this move. I feel like I could have reflected this more within my 3D environment, and that, because I focused more on the technical aspects for my project, I found myself lacking more in depth in the motif area. Overall I am very proud with the final product of my game, and believe that I have fulfilled all aspects of the brief to the best of my ability, if I was presented to complete this assignment again, I would most definitely do it again, and change different aspects that I have done.
