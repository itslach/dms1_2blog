>## **DESCRIPTION**
Due to the fact that I had just recently moved to melbourne only a month ago, it was quite difficult for me to really find a space that I connected well with, my obvious first idea was to just say my girlfriend and I's bedroom, but as that wasn't partically a provided option, I was stumped for a while on what I should pick, I eventually decided to pick a local billiards lounge that myself and my partner love to go to atleast 4-5 times a week, its important to me because it gives us time to bond outside of all our uni work and study and it brings us both a nice sense of enjoyement, being a place we can spend time together and have fun.
