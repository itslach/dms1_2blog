## **DESCRIPTION**
<p class="custom-font">
Due to the fact that I had just recently moved to melbourne only a month ago, it was quite difficult for me to really find a space that I connected well with, my obvious first idea was to just say my girlfriend and I's bedroom, but as that wasn't partically a provided option, I was stumped for a while on what I should pick, I eventually decided to pick a local billiards lounge that myself and my partner love to go to atleast 4-5 times a week, its important to me because it gives us time to bond outside of all our uni work and study and it brings us both a nice sense of enjoyement, being a place we can spend time together and have fun.

> ## *EVALUATION*

<p class="custom-font">
With this experimentation, I wanted to use basic effects to effectively convey the passing of time to the viewer, and that anywhere in the world time is always passing differently for everyone. I deliberately added a backing soundtrack that I felt made the video more peaceful and also added a metronome beat, that I could use to guide each cut between shots, this further added to the sense of time throughout the video> In roughly the middle of the video I used quick cuts every second to convey rapid movements, and used l-cuts and morph/dissolve transitions to elevate the viewing experience and add another layer of sensory relation.
