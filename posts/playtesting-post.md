## **REFLECTION AND RESULT**

The person I had playtest my prototype game was my girlfriend Iris, as someone who didn't heavily involve themself in video games or have much experience, I thought she would be a good test to see how the average person would interact with the environment and whether they would find it confusing or easy. She initially find navigating the menu pretty easy, as it was low in detail, as she loaded into the terrain, she began to explore the immediate area, taking immediate notice of the signs around that were intended to help guide the player, then making her way to the diner and exploring the other small areas of the map. I hadn't intended for the user to largely explore these areas as they were more for show, being somewhat deselate and just made up of props, they were more to create a more immersive 3D environment.

She later discovered the arrows that were along the road, these were to guide the player into the subway entrance, they seemed to work as intended and as the player traversed into the metro scene this was the area I was most intrigued about the interaction with, as it, at the time was the most heavily populated area with interactions. The player was immediately drawn to the floating orb that was in the middle of the path, ultimately leading them to the note on the floor, the player didn't immediately look down, but after noticing the orb moving down, eventually saw the note on the floor. After reading the popup, informing them on how to interact with the note, they picked it up, and were shown how to use the flashlight. This interaction aspect was effective for teaching the user how to use a tool within the game.

After interacting with the note she further explored the environment for a while and then found the key for the first door, and immediately knew what it's use was for. The player then traversed through the locked room, interacting with the note, picking up the second key and then testing the light switch a few times. The player then traversed down the steps, into the end stage environment, in this stage they quickly interacted with the NPC's in the area, having conversations with them, they then traversed into the room for the second key, but this room was still empty, they then found their way into the subway train, in which they interacted with the final NPC, and then the prototype testing was finished.

It was obvious after watching this test playthrough that my game had several issues/bugs and was far from finished. Also in regards to depth and game area, it was also very far from a finished/polished product. I felt as if the user found it relatively easy to navigate throughout the environment and found different interaction points easy enough to locate and interact with, I noticed their was a struggle with interacting with NPC's and that for some reason the 'X' interaction was slow to register and extremely buggy as to which when the user was actually able to interact. I was pleasantly suprised with the fact that the all the interaction systems in place for the user were functional, ranging from the key/door system to the dialogue system, light switch and automatic tram doors. I feel that after this playthrough, I need to make the change that this environment is portraying more obvious, it seems that the idea of me moving from home doesn't have a strong sense throughout playing the game and it is clear I have focused on the functional aspects of the game first. I would like to possibly implement more areas/environments that lead up to this final area the player has explored. I believe this would help create that motif that I am looking to immerse the player in, I could possibly have them start in some bedroom style area, then traverse to a seperate area (possibly with teleporting?)

I also believe after watching this playtest, that, my technical abilities are very advanced throughout my project and have shown impressive skills in coding different aspects of my environment.
