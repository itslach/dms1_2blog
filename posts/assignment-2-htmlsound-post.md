<p class="custom-font">
I started uploading my icons to my html by adding style css to the < head > of my code, in which the image container and row components were clarified, essentially informing the system of how the row's variables should be measured and padding it needs to apply.
<style>
  .custom-font {
    font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
  }
</style>

<p class="custom-font">
I then added in the DIV containers, the purpose of these is to hold all the image information for each icon. In each div container I added 3 icons, clarifying their; class, image source, image ID and the height and width of each image. The image source tells the machine where to retrieve the image from and the image ID is a value that will be useful later on when adding the alternative image.
