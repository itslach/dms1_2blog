Initially, when reading through the brief for assignment 3, I had a variety of possible ideas I wanted to pursue, my first idea was to create an expansive open terrain environment, that a player would traverse through during a quicker day-night cycle, with lots of random, player triggered events occuring, the open-environment map would have different water aspects for the player to traverse over and high mountain ranges. I also knew I wanted to implement some sort of npc and interaction system, to create a companion for the player that would guide them through the map. Below I have various inspiration for the first style of game I wanted to create, I was taking heavy inspiration from the popular game 'Legend of Zelda' as it's art and play style were very similar to what I wanted to create.

My second idea was to create a PS1, semi-open world game. During this time I was highly interested in retro/indie style ps1 horror games, these tended to be made by smaller teams/projects and are highly unappreciated. This idea also stood out to me as I had experience creating within this field, during my time in highschool, I spent a year creating a ps1 style procedural horror game for my multimedia major project, which meant I had some level of experience not only creating environments for this genre, but also designing and creating 3D assets, shaders and textures. I took heavy inspiration from a PS1 game that was actually made using the unity engine, called 'Bloodwash'. This horror style game uses audio in a super effective way, immersing the user in the environment, and making every jumpscare more effective. I also took inspiration from several other PS1 style games, including games like 'Silent Hill' and etc.
