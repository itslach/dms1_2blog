I began my Unity project by experimenting with a Greybox Prototype, which essentially an extremely rough 'sketch' of the game environment. I started by creating a 150 x 150 unit terrain for my map. I also installed the custom package, 'Terrain Tools' which adds a more detailed system for editing the terrain, I initally raised the terrain to 100 units on the Z - axis, I then used the 'Raise or Lower Terrain Tool' to began shaping my terrain, the reason I had raised it at the beginning was to allow me to lower certain parts of the terrain further, so I could create a beach inlet and lakes.

After creating the terrain, I began to use simple shapes to gather an idea of where different aspects would go in the environment, I used shapes like; cubes, ellipses, planes etc to give myself an idea of where objects like trees, rocks, buildings, and other props would go. This was very effective in helping visualise the busieness of the environment and whether or not I needed to add more or remove props from the environment.
