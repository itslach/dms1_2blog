After several changes and iterations to my project, I believe I can say that I am quite proud of the final product I have created, through use of several editing principles and techniques and different digital mediums I was able to convey the themes of Memory, Nostalgia and who I am to the viewer. By experimenting with discontinuity, synchresis, diegetic and non-diegetic audio and a wide variety of shot types and cut styles, I was effectively able to change the audience reaction between volitional and reactive when intended, and by applying Design Thinking in my brainstorming and storyboarding process, was able to create a smooth flowing film. All decisions made throughout my film were intentional towards the tone of abstractness, I wanted to be able to convey who I am as a person without both being a day in the life and telling the audience who I aim to be. I didn't wanna address that section of my life as I am still unsure of what I want to be, but I had these sure moments from my past that I knew made me who I am today, so I decided to target these aspects, as I could delve deeper into them and become more passionate about them. I believe I was quite successful in the execution of my project while adhering to the brief. There were challenging moments I faced throughout the editing phase as I was desperate to expand beyong the limit that we were set to stay within, wanting to use challenging and more visually appealing editing techniques, I was forced to restrain my self to using the basic principles of editing.
