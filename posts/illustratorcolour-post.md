After several experimentations with different colour schemes and palettes, I had come to a conclusion for my assignment project, that my desire was to use similar pastel colours in a split-complementary/triadic colour scheme. I believed these sorts of colours would be very effective in the creation of my icons and decided on them as lots of successful business/company logos use similar contrasting themes in their logos, I wanted my icons to stand out and draw the viewers attention quickly without being overly complex, as they would be icons used across a commercial website.
