I began experimenting with different colour schemes and icon layouts on Adobe Illustrator. It was during this experimentation that I underwent a major change for my project, after I began developing several different icons I had realised that they were not going to be very well suited to a video game HUD or commercial website, and was struggling to think of icons that would work in this environment. After a few days of brainstorming I came to a conclusion, and decided to create icons that could be used on an overnight sleeping/rain weather app, especially targeted towards children. 

<div class="row">
        <div class="image-container"><img id="icon1" src="icons/icon1.png" height="200" width="200"/></div>
        <div class="image-container"><img id="icon2" src="icons/icon2.png" height="200" width="200"/></div>
        <div class="image-container"><img id="icon3" src="icons/icon3.png" height="200" width="200"/></div>
    </div>

I began to create a foundation for my icons, as seen in the above examples of my first three icons.
