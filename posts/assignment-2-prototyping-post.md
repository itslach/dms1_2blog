I began experimenting with different colour schemes and icon layouts on Adobe Illustrator. It was during this experimentation that I underwent a major change for my project, after I began developing several different icons I had realised that they were not going to be very well suited to a video game HUD or commercial website, and was struggling to think of icons that would work in this environment. After a few days of brainstorming I came to a conclusion, and decided to create icons that could be used on an overnight sleeping/rain weather app, especially targeted towards children. 

<style>
        .row{
            width:720px;
            margin: 10px auto 10px auto ;
        }
        .image-container {
            display: table-cell;
            vertical-align: middle;
            padding:20px;
        }
 </style>





<div class="row">
        <div class="image-container"><img id="icon1" src="icons/icon1.png" height="200" width="200"/></div>
        <div class="image-container"><img id="icon2" src="icons/icon2.png" height="200" width="200"/></div>
        <div class="image-container"><img id="icon3" src="icons/icon3.png" height="200" width="200"/></div>
    </div>


<style>
  .custom-font {
    font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
  }
</style>

<p class="custom-font">
I began to create a foundation for my icons, as seen in the above examples of my first three icons. I knew I wanted to use highly simplified shapes to create appealing and exciting images for kids, I used minimal colour in my icons, but utilised loud colours that stood out very easily and draw the viewers attention quickly. The main purpose for each icon was to be used as icons for different modes in the app.

        <div class="image-container"><img id="bettersleep" src="icons/bettersleep.png" height="250" width="500"/></div>
        <div class="image-container"><img id="google" src="icons/google.jpg" height="250" width="500"/></div>
        <div class="image-container"><img id="sleepsounds" src="icons/sleepsounds.png" height="250" width="500"/></div>

I took heavy inspiration from the mobile app 'BetterSleep', as they used a variety of minimalistic style icons across their app, displayed as buttons that commit different actions across the platform. I wanted to utilise their idea but change it, and make it so that the icon would change to a different image when it is pressed. I also took inspiration from other platforms like, Google's 'Sleep App' and another app named 'Sleep Sounds'. The google platform stood out to me for their use of a monochromatic colour style, accompanied by very minimalistic icons for their functions. While the sleep sounds app used different colour schemes for it's apps functions; some split complementary, some triadic, some monochromatic and etc. I appreciated how they were able to use different colour schemes throughout their app's layout to make the different functions stand out.

<div class="row">
        <div class="image-container"><img id="icon1.2" src="icons/icon1.2.png" height="200" width="200"/></div>
        <div class="image-container"><img id="icon2.2" src="icons/icon2.2.png" height="200" width="200"/></div>
        <div class="image-container"><img id="icon3.3" src="icons/icon3.2.png" height="200" width="200"/></div>
    </div>

<style>
  .custom-font {
    font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
  }
</style>

<p class="custom-font">
After trialing a few different alternate designs for each icon, these were the 3 alternatives I designed to go with for my first 3 icons. I knew that I wanted my icons to have atleast a singular aspect that would create a strong family connection between them, considering that they were going to be used together on a sleep sounds app.



<div class="row">
        <div class="image-container"><img id="icon4" src="icons/icon4.png" height="200" width="200"/></div>
        <div class="image-container"><img id="icon5" src="icons/icon5.png" height="200" width="200"/></div>
        <div class="image-container"><img id="icon6" src="icons/icon6.png" height="200" width="200"/></div>
    </div>

<div class="row">
        <div class="image-container"><img id="icon7" src="icons/icon7.png" height="200" width="200"/></div>
        <div class="image-container"><img id="icon8" src="icons/icon8.png" height="200" width="200"/></div>
        <div class="image-container"><img id="icon9" src="icons/icon9.png" height="200" width="200"/></div>
    </div>

<style>
  .custom-font {
    font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
  }
</style>

I then created the last 6 icons, with their alternatives, but something wasn't right, as much as I loved the designs I had come up with for my icons, I didn't believe the icons had any strong sense that they belonged together and I wasnt happy with the quality of the products I had produced. So I ultimately decided to scrap these Icons, being that the due date was very close and I was starting from scratch I had to quickly come up with a strong theme for my new icons and start developing them.
