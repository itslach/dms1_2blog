At the time of producing this draft of my self portrait, the deadline for submission was very close and I was aiming for the draft to also be good enough for my final submission. During this process I faced many challenged that I found myself rushing to get sections finished, this caused me to make mistakes in my editing-forcing me to go back and repeat several steps over, also at the time I had added sections in my film that I felt were crucial to my project, but after feedback from peers was alerted that they were outside the briefs guidlines. The final image montage (1:35) had a film overlay that I had added to each photo in post-production, at the time I hadn't realised that the footage had to be completely unedited and I had believed that it added not just a layer of depth to the film, but also helped reinforced the theme of memories, that each photo was being captured with the sounds of the camera shutter in synchresis with a grainy overlay making the footage seem vintage. This was a moment where I believed the success of my project was gone because this was such a crucial aspect to the film, I ultimately kept the image montage but simply removed the overlay from each video clip, the effect of the video was essentially unchanged and it had helped me realise that not every moment needs to be overedited and less can be more in certain moments. The second moment was at the very end of the film, I had used a simple mask overlay on some b-roll footage I had captured a few years ago, I overlayed it so the screen would be a grainy-pinkish/red, with the text 'this is me' and the b-roll footage playing inside the text, I loved this technique as I believed it was simple but seemed to be an effective outro to my film when used in synchresis with the soundtrack. I opted to still try to create this effect, but with another source, at this time I was still unsure how I would achieve this, but knew I could keep it in the film and lose the potential boost in marks for that 10 seconds. I ultimately believe that my draft was a pretty decent representation of my final project and leaved little that had to be altered and I am proud of the effort I've put in so far to achieve this.
