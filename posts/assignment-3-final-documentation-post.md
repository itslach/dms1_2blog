I wanted to create a scene of a run-down style area/town because I thought it invoked a sense of sadness that I felt when I was moving away from home, which I wanted to subtly reflect onto the player. I created this scene by acquiring free building and road assets from the UNITY ASSET STORE. After acquiring these assets, I realised they came with a terrain prefab as well, it was perfect for the vibe of the town with grey soil and desolate areas. I imported it into my scene and immediately realised it was alot larger than the designated 300x300 area. To overcome this challenge I created invisible barriers around the town, this was doneto keep the player within the intended play area.

Once I had the area setup, I needed to create a hole that would fit the entrance to the metro subway, I achieved this by first pulling the metro scene into the town scene, overlaying the entrance slightly above the ground. Then using this as a guide I used the Paint Holes editor on the terrain, by then reducing the brush size to 2 and opacity to 20, I was able to create very specific holes that would help e to accurately cut out the terrain.
