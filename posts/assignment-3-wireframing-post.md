# **WIREFRAMING PROCESS**

### **IN-CLASS TASK**

In class we were tasked to pick a website of our choosing and to the best of our knowledge, recreate the front page of the website in a 'wireframe' format, I chose to recreate the 'Spotify' home page, as it was just a website I use alot and could remember very well.

This was my first iteration of the wireframe website. I had got the basic aspects of the layout well sorted, although had missed out on some more intricate details and some places were slightly out of place etc. We were then allowed to look at the website and alter or remake our wireframe, in which I altered mine and came out with a new, more accurate wireframe.

This was the second iteration I created of the spotify home page, building on from my previous version, I made this by looking back and forth at my first versions. After doing that research it was clear that I had forgotten alot of the minor details of this project, which I then had to amend later on.

## **PORTFOLIO WIREFRAMING**

I then moved on to creating wireframes for my portfolio website. I wanted to recreate a brutalist/minimalist layout while incorporating some of my own personal work and the 3 tasks I had completed from this semester.
