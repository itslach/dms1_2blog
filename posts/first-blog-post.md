    Attached is screen-captured evidence of me utilising html code to not only add in a .gif file into my blog, but learning how to change the size and orientation of the image. The described code is highlighted in drawn area.

    Attached is the creation of the Scavenger Hunt blog post, which I utilised several different coding techniques. I was able to attach <span class="bold">png</span> files, an animated <span class="bold">.gif</span> file, <span class="bold">horizontal rules</span>, and <span class="bold">bold</span> text.

   Attached is evidence that I was able to use video embeding and code to upload a video to my blog, at the time of this screenshot I just used a filler video of a random youtube video, just to test if it would work. The uploading of a video from youtube to the blog required retrieving an <span class="bold">embed</span> link for the <span class="bold">.mp4</span> file from <span class="bold">youtube</span>, I then utilised <span class="bold">module scripts</span> to alter the <span class="bold">height</span> and <span class="bold">width</span> of the video player.

  Attached is evidence that I was able to use style syntax and custom font familys to implement different font styles into my blog. I used my further research into markdown and tailwind to teach myself how I could do this in the most easy way. I used this technical skill in my blog to create contrast and showcase my use of technical abilities throughout my project/homework.

   Attached is the creation of a vector logo/img that I quickly made in Adobe Illustrator. I added this to my blog for fun/extra challenge as I felt like my blog was missing something substantial to make it more visually appealing, and I really like when websites having images to draw attention, so I decided to make something simple and quick to build towards this idea and add a layer of depth to my video.

   This was the first prototype design for an image logo header for my blog page. Using a combination of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator I created this simple 3D text design to use as my Header, as I was obsessed with these sorts of themes of text with a glossy/chromatic finish. I unfortunately do not have any screenshot records of this creation process.

<p>
    <span class="highlight">2024.08.07</span>
   This was the second prototype blog logo design and ultimately the final design I chose to use. I had become interested with brutalism and metalheart designs in graphic designs at the time and saw lots of these theme text logos, that fall under a category of 'angelic grunge' and decided to replicate it for my project. The design was relatively easy to make in Adobe Photoshop and only took a few hours, I unfortunately do not have any screenshots for this process either.
