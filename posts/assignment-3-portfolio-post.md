For the second project in my portfolio, I wanted to really shift the vibe and layout of the project, because the premise of this project was so different to the first project, I decided to reflect this in the layout. The first thing I did was implement a new frame with it's own horizontal scrolling, within this frame I put my nine icons, for the user to scroll through and observe. I then added in different information and reflection around the page on seperate cards.
